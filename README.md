# DeepCubeA_Exercises_toariyo

This repository contains solved exercises from Solved exercises from DeepCubeA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that can learn to solve the Rubik's cube. These exercises utilize Deep Reinforcement Learning and neural networks. These exercises were solved over the course of a research internship with the Artificial Intelligence Institute at University of South Carolina. Access to DeepCubeA can be found here: https://github.com/forestagostinelli/DeepCubeA. Additional help and assistance was provided by Michael Sana and Forest Agostinelli.
